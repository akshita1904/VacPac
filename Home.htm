        <br /><h1><u><b>What are Vaccines</u></b></h1><br />
        <p>A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease.
 A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or
killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins.</p>

	<h1><b><u>History of Vaccines</b></u></h1>
	<p>The practice of immunisation dates back hundreds of years. Buddhist monks drank snake venom to confer immunity to snake bite and variolation (smearing of a skin tear with cowpox to confer immunity to smallpox) was practiced in 17th century China. Edward Jenner is considered the founder of vaccinology in the West in 1796, after he inoculated a 13 year-old-boy with vaccinia virus (cowpox), and demonstrated immunity to smallpox. In 1798, the first smallpox vaccine was developed. Over the 18th and 19th centuries, systematic implementation of mass smallpox immunisation culminated in its global eradication in 1979.</p>
  <p> The first vaccine was discovered by Edward Jenner against smallpox.</p>
