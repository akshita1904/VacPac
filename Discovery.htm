      <p>Edward Jenner, FRS FRCPE (17 May 1749 â€“ 26 January 1823) was an English physician and scientist who pioneered the concept of
        vaccines including creating the smallpox vaccine, the world's first vaccine.</p>
      <br />
      <p>In 1796 Edward Jenner inserted pus taken from Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid with cowpox, into a cut made in the arm of a local boy,
        James Phipps. Several days later, Jenner exposed the boy to smallpox. He was found to be immune. Jenner called his new
        method 'vaccination' after the Latin word for cow (vacca).</p>
      <br />
      <p>Edward Jenner was an English country doctor who introduced the vaccine for smallpox. Previously a keen practitioner of
        smallpox inoculation, Jenner took the principle a stage further by inducing immunity against this killer disease via exposure to
        a harmless related disease, cowpox. His technique provided safer and more reliable protection than traditional inoculation.</p>
